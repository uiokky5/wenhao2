# BIOGRAPGHY

I am a Master's student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University. I am set to obtain my Master's degree in **2025**, advised by Prof. **[Yuwei Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DR-GIokAAAAJ&hl=en)**. For my undergraduate studies, I attended the School of Computer Science at Xidian University, achieving a GPA of **3.7**. During my master's program, I have actively contributed to four significant projects in **[Cross-Modal Person Re-identification (VI-ReID)](#renet-reliable-and-efficient-cross-modality-learning-for-unsupervised-visible-and-infrared-person-re-identification-usl-vi-reid)**, **[Brain Age Prediction](#a-6-month-internship-at-the-wan-lab-university-of-nebraska-medical-center)**, and **[Non-learned Operator based Deep Learning Models](#lightweight-directional-aware-network-for-classification)**. 

<span style="color:red;">I intend to pursue a Ph.D. program in <strong><span style="color:red;">Fall 2025</span></strong> with a focus on Multi-Modal Learning, especially within the realms of AI for Human or Societal Benefit.
