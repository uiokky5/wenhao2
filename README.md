## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**Research Assistant**  
Xidian University  
May 2022-present

**Project:** A 6-month Internship at the Wan-Lab, University of Nebraska Medical Center
- Collaborated on advancing the project in predicting brain age using local image features of T1-MRI scans.
- Optimized and enhanced the Local U-Net for Brain Age Prediction by utilizing the Swin Transformer. The code has been open-sourced and is available at [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wan-mlab/Swin-U-NET).

**Project:** Transferring Modality-Aware Pedestrian Attentive Learning for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID).
- Proposed a data augmentation PedMix, tailored for VI-ReID, effectively improving the mean Average Precision (mAP) by 4.67%.
- Introduced a Modality Feature Transfer module, integrating cross-attention and convolution networks with minimum computational overhead, generating discriminative modality-complete features.
- Submission Update: AAAI 2024 (3 wa & 1 wr) to TCSVT.

**Project:** RENet: Reliable and Efficient Cross Modality Learning for Unsupervised Visible and Infrared Person Re-identification (USL-VI-ReID).
- Proposed Hashing-based Metric to reliably measure the cross-modal similarity, improving the Rank-1 accuracy by 2.39% compared to the commonly used distance metrics.
- Devised a Multi-directional Update module to efficiently bridge the modal gap, achieving SOTA performance.

**Project:** Lightweight Directional-Aware Network for Classification.
- Conducted a comprehensive review of all non-learned operators-based Deep Learning models, providing a classification of current methods.
- Introduced a lightweight directional-aware network, achieving state-of-the-art performance at a significantly lower computational cost.
- Submitted to Artificial Intelligence Review. (Revision Submitted)
